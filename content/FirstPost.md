Summary: This is a test to see if I can get something working


# First Post
***
Pelican  is not as easy as people make it out to be.
If you want the website on *github.io* and you also want the source code to be up there as well you need to do some interesting workarounds.  
And then if you don't have access to a way to run make then you need to recreate them as batch files.  
It is all quite confusing but hopefully I will get it to work eventually.
